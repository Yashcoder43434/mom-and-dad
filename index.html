Every day they put food on the table so we can eat. They work day and night to provide for our family. They are also lots of fun. When I am bored daddy plays pass with me. Mommy also plays pass with me and she draws and plays tag too! In the end, without my parents I wouldn't be the awesome, superior, excellent, brave, fantastic, selfless, kind, considerate, helpful, amazing, smart, athletic, loved person I am today. Thank you both you are my everything. Happy Anniversary! Wish you lots of years of love ahead! lol </p></section>
